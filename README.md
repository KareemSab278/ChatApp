15/3 - didnt do anything today. was messing around trying to use chat21 for the chatting app and spent the whole day trying to figure it out. i guess ill just make it myself and throw security out the window for now

16/3 - will be getting back on soon, just taking a brief break. ill made the backend myself and link it to mongodb for now. i made it work before and i can do it again.

18/3 - getting back on it rn. designed the db and will be suing mongodb and cloudinary.

22/3 - making progress-ish

29/3 - feel like trash. fasting got me messed up. ramadan is almost done so imma do one stretch to get this chat app thing working before im gonna be hyperfocused on assignments (ive got three due next month and barely started). dont hyperfocus on doing side quests!
